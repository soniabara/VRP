Optimization of Vehicle Routing Problem | Self Project 
Objective: To optimize logistics by applying Genetic Algorithms to the Vehicle Routing Problem, enhancing efficiency and reducing distance
•Applied customized chromosome encoding and Alternating Edge Crossover method to generate high-quality offspring solutions
•Used Inversion and Swap mutation to enhance solution diversity, prevent premature convergence and optimize search space exploration
•Utilized DEAP Library to fine-tune the Algorithm, resulting in an optimized fitness of 836.9249 and 20% reduction in total distance
